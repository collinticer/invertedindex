# invertedindex

To use this library, simply call:
```python
searchWord('word')
```

Or, to search an entire phrase by splitting the string at each space, use:
```python
searchPhrase('hello world')
```

To override the default term frequency calculation, define a custom `tf(termFrequency, termWieght)` function.

For example, the default definition of:

```python
def tf(termFrequency, frequencyWeight):
	return 1 + math.log10(termFrequency * frequencyWeight)
```

Could be overridden, as:

```python
def tf(termFrequency, frequencyWeight):
	return termFrequency
```
Which would output the raw term frequency.

Below, is information on overriding each of the functions.

To learn more about term frequency, inverse document frequency, and Term frequencyâ€“Inverse document frequency calculations, [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is a great starting point.

####`tf(termFrequency, termWeight)`####

Default definition:

```python
def tf(termFrequency, frequencyWeight):
	return 1 + math.log10(termFrequency * frequencyWeight)
```

Example overriden function:

```python
def tf(termFrequency, frequencyWeight):
	return termFrequency
```

####`idf(totalDocuments, numberDocumentsContainingQuery)`####

Default definition:

```python
def idf(totalDocuments, numberDocumentsContainingQuery):
	idf = math.log10(totalDocuments / numberDocumentsContainingQuery)
	return idf
```

Example overriden function:

```python
def idf(totalDocuments, numberDocumentsContainingQuery):
	idf = math.log10(1 + (totalDocuments / numberDocumentsContainingQuery))
	return idf
```

####`tfidf(totalDocuments, numberDocumentsContainingQuery)`####

Default definition:

```python
def tfidf(tf, idf, docID):
	return (tf * idf) * timeRelevanceWeight(docID)
```

Example overriden function:

```python
def tfidf(tf, idf, docID):
	#ommiting time relevance from calculation
	return tf * idf
```

####`timeRelevanceWeight(docID)`####

Default definition:

```python
def timeRelevanceWeight(docID):
    #for now, simply return weight of 1 so it doesn't affect calculations if it is used
    return 1.0
```

Example overriden function:

```python
def timeRelevanceWeight(docID):
    #would definitely want to perform some sort of database lookup in order to retrieve creation / last revised date for the document, hard coded values
    #I used are just for proof of concept, and would result in each document being weighted the same
    tuple_time = time.strptime("2004-06-03T00:44:35", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
    firstDocPosted = time.mktime(tuple_time)#time at witch oldest document in results was posted. obvious dummy value for proof of concept
    tuple_time = time.strptime("2012-06-03T00:44:35", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
    lastDocPosted = time.mktime(tuple_time)#initialize time of last document in results creation time
    tuple_time = time.strptime("2010-06-03T00:44:35", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
    thisDocPosted = time.mktime(tuple_time)#initialize time of this documents creation to somewhere between first and last document
    timeRelevanceWeight = (thisDocPosted - firstDocPosted) / (lastDocPosted - firstDocPosted)
    return timeRelevanceWeight
```
